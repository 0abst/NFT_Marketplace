# Tutorial NFT Marketplace (with Solidity and Javascript)

This repository is based on the following website:

https://dev.to/edge-and-node/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb

The aim here has been to reproduce the code in the tutorial in order to become better familiar with the technology. This tutorial had been followed in January 2022 and updated in September 2022.

We have the following structure:

 * NFT Marketplace: The smart contract 

 * Building the front end

 * Creating and listing NFTs

 * Viewing only the NFTs purchased by the user

 * Dashboard

 * Reselling a token

A demo as a video of the implementation can be found here:

The main learnings from this have been:

 * How to create a simple marketplace - both locally as well as on Polygon

 * Getting more familiar with Hardhat

 * Debugging, facing several issues:

   *  For instance, deprecation from Infura (https://blog.infura.io/post/ipfs-public-api-and-gateway-deprecation) - September 2022

#### How to use the code:

##### Make sure to add from Infura the projectID and projectSecret in create-item.js

##### Deploy the smart contract

##### Run a node (npx hardhat node)

##### Run the app (npm run dev)
